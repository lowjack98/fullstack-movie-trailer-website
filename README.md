FullStack-Nanodegree-Movie-Trailer-Website
===============================

This project provides server-side code to store a list of my favorite movies,
including the box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. You can then serve this
data as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the
trailers.

Installation
===============================

Copy the files to a folder on your local system. Once python is installed, run:

`python entertainment_center.py`

Usage
===============================

To add, edit, or remove movies, edit the entertainment_center.py file.
New movies can be added using the media class and Movie method. Once added, be
sure to add the new variable to the movies array.

The media.py and fresh_tomatoes.py files should remain untouched.
